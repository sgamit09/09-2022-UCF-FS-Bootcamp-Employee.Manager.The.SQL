# Description 📖

Managing the State Military from FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood using a combination of  Javascript and SQL. 


# Installation 🧰

## Softwares Needed 🔍

* Google Chrome or Web Browser
* Node.js
* npm modules
* mySQL
* DBeaver

# Usage 👨🏻‍💻

Created the database of Departments, Roles, and Employees based on FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Then using npm inquirer prompts, user will perform CRUDDY commands to create, read, update, and delete throughtout all the tables and database in search for the truth and to get their bodies back. Below are some screenshots of the program in action. If you seem lost with all these references to this show, give it a watch. It's probably one of the top animes of all time.
